shape_evoultion_java
====================


My final year project. 

Brief was to investigate the possibilty of combining Cellular Automatas, Genetic Algorithm and Interactive Evoultion
to generate 3D shapes.

The idea being that this software could be used to generate ideas for products. The Cellular Automata becomes a 3D 
representation of the shape. Each space becomes a voxel (3D pixel)

Application allows a user to select shapes, combine them and then export them to an STL file so that they could be
printed using a 3D printer.

Known Issues:
-Cellular Automata is not very effective, in that it is too small a resoultion
-Expensive Computationally
-Hard to compile and run (even if it is JAVA!), porting to Python
